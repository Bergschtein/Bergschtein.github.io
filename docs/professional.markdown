## Scientific Publications

In the spring of 2024, Erlend Lokna and i worked together on our master theses. We investigated a novel use of self-supervised learning (SSL) for improving *tokenization* in a generative model for time series. Our efforts lead to quite promising results regarding the quality of learned representations and generative quality, among others. 

We wrote our contributions up as a paper, *Blending Low and High-Level Semantics of Time Series for Better Masked Time Series Generation*, and got accepted to the [ML4ITS2024](https://ml4its.github.io/ml4its2024/) workshop at [ECML-PKDD 2024](https://ecmlpkdd.org/2024/).

We had the honor of presenting our work at ECML-PKDD 2024 in Vilnius, Lithuania.

You can read the paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16613) or download the paper [here](/assets/paper.pdf).


## Studies

I was a student at NTNU Trondheim from autumn 2018 until spring 2024.

### Master In Statistics

Focus on theoretical and practical aspects of computational statistics. From statistical learning theory and model selection, bayesian methods such as MCMC, and machine learning and AI.  

My thesis revolved around representation learning for generative models for time series. You can download the thesis [here.](/assets/Master_thesis.pdf)

### (A taste of a) Master In Cyber Security and Data Communication



### Bachelors In Mathematics

Incredibly curious 


My thesis serves as an introduction to the theory of Triangulated Categories. You can download the thesis [here.](/assets/professional/Bachelor_thesis.pdf)
