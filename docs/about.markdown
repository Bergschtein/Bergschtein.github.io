I am a mathematician educated at NTNU with a deep interest in technology, data, and innovative solutions. My strong analytical skills and curiosity drive me to explore and master new challenges, particularly in data analysis, machine learning, and technical communication.

With a passion for sharing knowledge, I have gained extensive experience as a personal tutor, author of compendiums, and speaker in both academic and informal settings. I am a skilled communicator who understands the value of presenting complex concepts in an understandable and engaging way, both to technical and non-technical audiences.

Recently, I have been published as a researcher through my master's thesis, a testament to my dedication and ability to deliver high-quality work. 

Additionally, I have solid leadership experience, managing a group of over 300 members. My strong leadership skills and ability to balance technical and interpersonal skills reflect my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

## Scientific Publications

In the spring of 2024, Erlend Lokna and I worked together on our master theses. We investigated a novel use of self-supervised learning (SSL) for improving *tokenization* in a generative model for time series. Our efforts lead to quite promising results regarding the quality of learned representations and generative quality, among others. 

We wrote our contributions up as a paper, *Blending Low and High-Level Semantics of Time Series for Better Masked Time Series Generation*, and got accepted to the [ML4ITS2024](https://ml4its.github.io/ml4its2024/) workshop at [ECML-PKDD 2024](https://ecmlpkdd.org/2024/).

We had the honor of presenting our work at ECML-PKDD 2024 in Vilnius, Lithuania.

You can read the paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16613) or download the paper [here](/assets/paper.pdf).


## Studies

From august 2018 until the june of 2024 I was a student at NTNU Trondheim.

### Master In Statistics 

My main interests revolved around on theoretical and practical aspects of computational statistics. From statistical learning theory and bayesian inference with MCMC to machine learning and AI.

The thesis revolved around representation learning for generative models for time series. You can download the thesis [here.](/assets/Master_thesis.pdf)

### (A taste of a) Master In Cyber Security and Data Communication

Following a theoretical study of algebra, cryptography and coding theory, I was curious about cyber security. 

I studied network protocols throughout the OSI model, performed risk analyses of ICT systems and worked with database management systems.

I wrote a compendium for the course Algorithms and Data structures. Download the compendium [here](/assets/professional/AlgDat_kompendium.pdf) (norwegian only).

### Bachelors In Mathematics

I was incredibly curious about pure mathematics, algebra and topology in particular. The idea of a unified framework for mathematics through category theory caught my attention early. I developed a good relationship with my supervisor-to-be, Johanne Haugland. She provided many fruitful discussions and interesting challenges.
In parallel I got involved with cryptography, coding theory and computational sciences.

My thesis serves as an introduction to the theory of Triangulated Categories. You can download the thesis [here.](/assets/professional/Bachelor_thesis.pdf)
